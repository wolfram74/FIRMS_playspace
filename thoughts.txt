step1:
	download the bulk data from FIRMS
	https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/active_fire/
	two months collection should be fine first go
	since I want ukraine /probably/ europe, but maybe it's in the asia batch
step2:
	check long-lat vs ukraine location to see if it's the places I want
Step3:
	start parsing out the incidents more agressively focusing just on the region of interest
step4:
	see what a 2 day rolling average looks like
step5:
	just go buck wild.


wget -e robots=off -m -np -R .html,.tmp -nH --cut-dirs=4 "https://nrt3.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/api/v2/content/archives/FIRMS/modis-c6.1/" --header "Authorization: Bearer INSERT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" -P ./data

since I have MODIS data
https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/find-data/near-real-time/firms/mcd14dl-nrt#ed-firms-attributes

fields:
	latitude+ longitude: pretty obv
	brightness: apparently a temperature rating, interesting
	scan+track: while the goal is a 1km square pixel, acquisition process deforms that slightly
	acq_date+acq_time: yeppers
	satellite: aqua or terra sats
	confidence: 0-100 confidence percentage
	version: looks like some collection types
	bright_t31:another temperature reading 
	frp: power output
	daynight: whether or not it's day night

location data:
	https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/ukraine/location
	center is put at 48.4 n and 31.2 E
	E bounds: 22.25 to 40.25
	N bounds: 52.3, 45.3

	seems to agree with that, so treating ukraine like a rectangle for the sake of argument
	will grab a lot of moldova, some romania, belarus and poland.
