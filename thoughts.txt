step1:
	download the bulk data from FIRMS
	https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/active_fire/
	two months collection should be fine first go
	since I want ukraine /probably/ europe, but maybe it's in the asia batch
step2:
	check long-lat vs ukraine location to see if it's the places I want
Step3:
	start parsing out the incidents more agressively focusing just on the region of interest
step4:
	see what a 2 day rolling average looks like
step5:
	just go buck wild.
